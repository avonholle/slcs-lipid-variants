	abstract = {Although cardiovascular disease has traditionally been viewed as a condition of aging individuals, increasing focus has turned to its developmental origins. Since birthweight has been related to cardiovascular disease risk, research into factors such as gravid conditions that affect fetal growth have grown. Associations between maternal diabetes and childhood obesity from sibling studies suggest a causal role but prospective studies of gestational diabetes remain mixed. Preeclampsia and increased offspring blood pressure has been consistently observed but evidence for other cardiovascular outcomes is lacking. While maternal obesity is associated with childhood obesity, causality remains unclear and paternal obesity should be investigated as an independent risk factor. Environmental chemical exposures in utero, particularly obesogens, are now emerging as another concern, as is conception by infertility treatment. Few studies have investigated subclinical measures of endothelial function or atherosclerosis and more research in these areas may help reveal the underlying pathogenesis.},

	volume = {112},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: To determine the behavioral and developmental effects of preventing iron-deficiency anemia in infancy.
{METHODS}: Healthy full-term Chilean infants who were free of iron-deficiency anemia at 6 months were assigned to high- or low-iron groups or to high- or no-added-iron groups. Behavioral/developmental outcomes at 12 months of age included overall mental and motor test scores and specific measures of motor functioning, cognitive processing, and behavior. There were no differences between high- and low-iron groups in the prevalence of iron-deficiency anemia or behavioral/developmental outcome, and they were combined to form an iron-supplemented group (n = 1123) for comparison with the no-added-iron group (n = 534).
{RESULTS}: At 12 months, iron-deficiency anemia was present in 3.1\% and 22.6\% of the supplemented and unsupplemented groups, respectively. The groups differed in specific behavioral/developmental outcomes but not on global test scores. Infants who did not receive supplemental iron processed information slower. They were less likely to show positive affect, interact socially, or check their caregivers' reactions. A smaller proportion of them resisted giving up toys and test materials, and more could not be soothed by words or objects when upset. They crawled somewhat later and were more likely to be tremulous.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The results suggest that unsupplemented infants responded less positively to the physical and social environment. The observed differences seem to be congruent with current understanding of the effects of iron deficiency on the developing brain. The study shows that healthy full-term infants may receive developmental and behavioral benefits from iron supplementation in the first year of life.},

	title = {The Role of Lipids and Lipoproteins in Atherosclerosis},
	rights = {Copyright © 2000-2016, {MDText}.com, Inc.},
	url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK343489/},
	abstract = {Atherosclerosis is the underlying cause of heart attack and stroke. Early observations that cholesterol is a key component of arterial plaques gave rise to the cholesterol hypothesis for the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Population studies have demonstrated that elevated levels of {LDL} cholesterol and apolipoprotein B ({apoB}) 100, the main structural protein of {LDL}, are directly associated with risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular events ({ASCVE}). Indeed, infiltration and retention of {apoB} containing lipoproteins in the artery wall is a critical initiating event that sparks an inflammatory response and promotes the development of atherosclerosis. Arterial injury causes endothelial dysfunction promoting modification of {apoB} containing lipoproteins and infiltration of monocytes into the subendothelial space. Internalization of the {apoB} containing lipoproteins by macrophages promotes foam cell formation, which is the hallmark of the fatty streak phase of atherosclerosis. Macrophage inflammation results in enhanced oxidative stress and cytokine/chemokine secretion, causing more {LDL}/remnant oxidation, endothelial cell activation, monocyte recruitment, and foam cell formation. {HDL}, {apoA}-I, and endogenous {apoE} prevent inflammation and oxidative stress and promote cholesterol efflux to reduce lesion formation. Macrophage inflammatory chemoattractants stimulate infiltration and proliferation of smooth muscle cells. Smooth muscle cells produce the extracellular matrix providing a stable fibrous barrier between plaque prothrombotic factors and platelets. Unresolved inflammation results in formation of vulnerable plaques characterized by enhanced macrophage apoptosis and defective efferocytosis of apoptotic cells resulting in necrotic cell death leading to increased smooth cell death, decreased extracellular matrix production, and collagen degradation by macrophage proteases. Rupture of the thinning fibrous cap promotes thrombus formation resulting in clinical ischemic {ASCVE}. Surprisingly, native {LDL} is not taken up by macrophages in vitro but has to be modified to promote foam cell formation. Oxidative modification converts {LDL} into atherogenic particles that initiate inflammatory responses. Uptake and accumulation of oxidatively modified {LDL} ({oxLDL}) by macrophages initiates a wide range of bioactivities that may drive development of atherosclerotic lesions. Lowering {LDL}-cholesterol with statins reduces risk for cardiovascular events, providing ultimate proof of the cholesterol hypothesis. All of the {apoB} containing lipoproteins are atherogenic, and both triglyceride rich remnant lipoproteins and Lp(a) promote atherothrombosis. Non-{HDL} cholesterol levels capture all of the {apoB} containing lipoproteins in one number and are useful in assessing risk in the setting of hypertriglyceridemia. Measures of {apoB} and {LDL}-P are superior at predicting risk for {ASCVE}, when levels of {LDL}-C and {LDL}-P are discordant. Here, we also describe the current landscape of {HDL} metabolism. Epidemiological studies have consistently shown that {HDL}-C levels are inversely related to {ASCVE}. We highlight recent clinical trials aimed at raising {HDL}-C that failed to reduce {CVE} and the shifting clinical targets of {HDL}-C, {HDL} particle numbers, and {HDL} function (e.g. cholesterol efflux capacity). Furthermore, we describe many beneficial properties of {HDL} that antagonize atherosclerosis and how {HDL} dysfunction may promote cardiometabolic disease.},

However, the understanding from genetic studies and negative results from randomised trials that low {HDL} cholesterol might not cause cardiovascular disease as originally thought has now generated renewed interest in raised concentrations of triglycerides. This renewed interest has also been driven by epidemiological and genetic evidence supporting raised triglycerides, remnant cholesterol, or triglyceride-rich lipoproteins as an additional cause of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality. Triglycerides can be measured in the non-fasting or fasting states, with concentrations of 2-10 mmol/L conferring increased risk of cardiovascular disease, and concentrations greater than 10 mmol/L conferring increased risk of acute pancreatitis and possibly cardiovascular disease. Although randomised trials showing cardiovascular benefit of triglyceride reduction are scarce, new triglyceride-lowering drugs are being developed, and large-scale trials have been initiated that will hopefully provide conclusive evidence as to whether lowering triglycerides reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease.},

Anthropometric measurements and arterial blood pressure were recorded. Body mass index was calculated. Fasting blood glucose, insulin and lipids levels, and glucose and insulin 2 h post-load glucose were measured. {HOMA}-{IR} was calculated. In order of frequency, sedentary lifestyle was observed in 49.3\% of participants, dyslipidemia in 28.3\%, overweight-obesity in 17.4\% (7.9\% obesity and 9.5\% overweight), pre-hypertension and hypertension ({PreHT}/{HT}) in 8.8\%, prediabetes in 4\%, insulin resistance in 3.9\% and metabolic syndrome ({MS}) in 2.5\%. {CRF}'s were associated with overweight-obesity, being the most common, dyslipidemia (50.3\% vs 23.7\% in normal weight) and {PreHT}/{HT} (23.8\% vs 5.7\%; p=0.0001 for both). The risk of {PreHT}/{HT}, dyslipidemia, and {MS} were 5.14, 3.26 and 119.56 times more in overweight-obesity, than in low-normal weight respectively (p=0.0001 for all). In conclusion, the frequency of overweight and obesity in Merida has increased over time. Given its clear association with {CRF}, it is recommended to provide the appropriated education to improve nutritional status.},

	abstract = {Abstract

Background: Studies have suggested that triglyceride to {HDL}-cholesterol ratio ({TRG}/{HDL}) is a surrogate marker of insulin resistance ({IR}), but information regarding its use in pediatric patients is limited. This study investigated the ability of {TRG}/{HDL} ratio to assess {IR} in obese and overweight children.

Methods: The sample consisted of de-identified electronic medical records of patients aged 10–17 years (n=223). Logistic regression was performed using {TRG}/{HDL} ratio as a predictor of hyperinsulinemia or {IR} defined using homeostasis model assessment score.

Results: {TRG}/{HDL} ratio had limited ability to predict hyperinsulinemia ({AUROC} 0.71) or {IR} ({AUROC} 0.72). Although females had higher insulin levels, male patients were significantly more likely to have hypertriglyceridemia and impaired fasting glucose.

Conclusions: {TRG}/{HDL} ratio was not adequate for predicting {IR} in this population. Gender differences in the development of obesity-related metabolic abnormalities may impact the choice of screening studies in pediatric patients.},

	abstract = {Background and aims: Lipid ratios to estimate atherosclerotic disease risk in overweight/obese children are receiving great attention. We aimed to compare the performance of non-high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol ({HDL}-C) versus triglycerides-to-{HDL}-C ratio (Tg/{HDL}-C) in identifying cardiometabolic risk factors ({CMRFs}) or preclinical signs of organ damage in outpatient Italian overweight/obese children.

Methods and results: In this retrospective, cross-sectional study, 5505 children (age 5-18 years) were recruited from 10 Italian centers for the care of obesity, of which 4417 (78\%) showed obesity or morbid obesity. Anthropometric, biochemical, and blood pressure variables were analyzed in all children. Liver ultrasound scan, carotid artery ultrasound, and echocardiography were performed in 1257, 601, and 252 children, respectively. The entire cohort was divided based on the 75th percentile of non-{HDL}-C ({\textgreater}= 130 mg/dl) or Tg/{HDL}-C ratio ({\textgreater}= 2.2). The odds ratio for insulin resistance, high blood pressure, metabolic syndrome, presence of liver steatosis, increased levels of carotid intima-media thickness ({cIMT}) and concentric left ventricular hypertrophy ({cLVH}) was higher in children with high levels of Tg/{HDL}-C with respect to children with high levels of non-{HDL}-C.

Conclusions: In an outpatient setting of overweight/obese children, Tg/{HDL}-C ratio discriminated better than non-{HDL}-C children with {CMRFs} or preclinical signs of liver steatosis, and increased {cIMT} and {cLVH}.},

In addition to genetic mechanisms, epigenetic causes are gaining new perspectives in human diseases related to gene deregulation. Most eukaryotic genes are packed into chromatin structures, which lead to high condensations of the genes that require dynamic chromatin remodeling processes to facilitate their transcription. {DNA} methylation and histone modifications represent two of the major chromatin remodeling processes. They also serve to integrate environmental signals for the cells to modulate the functional output of their genome. Complex human diseases such as cancer and type 2 diabetes are believed to have a strong environmental component in addition to genetic causes. Aberrancies in chromatin remodeling are associated with both genetically and environmentally-related diseases. We will focus on recent findings of the epigenetic basis of human metabolic disorders to facilitate further exploration of epigenetic mechanisms and better understandings of the molecular cues underlying such complex diseases.},

	shorttitle = {Iron deficiency in infancy},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Infants aged 6-24 mo are at high risk of iron deficiency. Numerous studies worldwide have sought to identify predictors of iron deficiency in this age group.
{OBJECTIVE}: The objectives of the study were to apply a physiologic model to identify risk factors for iron deficiency and to consider those risk factors under different conditions of iron supplementation. We predicted that factors related to iron status at birth (lower gestational age and lower birth weight), postnatal needs for iron (more rapid growth), and bioavailable iron (more cow milk) would be major risk factors.
{DESIGN}: The physiologic framework was assessed in 1657 Chilean infants (aged 12 mo) with birth weights {\textgreater}or=3 kg who were randomly assigned at age 6 mo to high or low iron supplementation or no added iron. Based on venous blood, the analysis used mean corpuscular volume and concentrations of hemoglobin, free erythrocyte protoporphyrin, and ferritin. Logistic regression models were used to identify predictors of iron deficiency anemia and iron deficiency without anemia.
{RESULTS}: The prevalence of iron deficiency ({\textgreater}or=2 abnormal iron measures) was 34.9\% at age 12 mo. Of 186 infants with hemoglobin concentrations {\textless}110 g/L, 158 (84.9\%) were iron deficient. The only consistent (and the strongest) predictor of iron deficiency or iron deficiency anemia was lower 6-mo hemoglobin. Factors related to poorer iron status at birth (lower birth weight, shorter gestation though full-term, or both) were predictors in the no-added-iron and high-iron groups. Otherwise, predictors varied by iron supplementation.
{CONCLUSION}: Variations in predictors of iron deficiency or iron deficiency anemia according to iron supplementation suggest that direct comparisons across studies are tenuous at best without data on early iron status and certainty that specific conditions are comparable.},

	abstract = {Elevated triglycerides ({TG}) or low high density lipoprotein cholesterol ({HDL}-C) levels are common cardiometabolic risk factors in children. From a systems genetics standpoint, Visualization of Statistical Epistasis Networks ({ViSEN}) is a nonparametric entropy-based method that can characterize the global structure of interacting genetic factors. We identified a novel set of connected genetic and cardiometabolic risk factors with strong and significant interaction effects on two important dyslipidemia phenotypes (low {HDL}-C and high {TG}) in children and adolescents. Study participants were recruited from five schools in Istanbul, Turkey (n=360; 170 boys, 190 girls). Participants with {TG} levels≥75th and {HDL}-C levels≤25th percentile were defined as ‘high {TG}’ and ‘low {HDL}-C’, respectively. We genotyped participants for six single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}) in five genes with known associations to lipid levels (rs328 in {LPL}, rs708272 in {CETP}, rs1800588 in {LIPC}, rs1800977 in {ABCA}1, rs1799941 and rs6257 in {SHBG} gene). {ViSEN} was used to identify associations with dyslipidemia phenotypes. There were 71 (50 males, 21 females) and 93 (60 males and 33 females) subjects with low {HDL}-C and high {TG}, respectively. Biological variables including age, gender, and {BMI} were significantly associated with both phenotypes (p{\textless}0.001). Importantly, a single {SNP}, rs708272, was associated with low {HDL}-C ({IG}=2.24\%, p=0.026). Pairwise and higher order interaction analyses in the full dataset for low {HDL}-C and high {TG} revealed the largest effects in the models containing rs1800977, rs708272, age ({IG}=6.20\%, p=0.046) and rs1800588, age, {BMI} ({IG}, 3.06\%, p=0.022), respectively. In conclusion, the present study brings us a step closer to a systems genetic approach in understanding lipid phenotypes in children. Further efforts can integrate population and laboratory-based studies, hence accelerate the preventive medicine efforts.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: To examine whether method of infant feeding is associated with adult serum lipid concentrations and mortality from ischaemic heart disease.
{DESIGN}: Follow up study of men born during 1911-30.
{SETTING}: Hertfordshire, England.
{SUBJECTS}: 5718 men, for 5471 of whom information on infant feeding had been recorded by health visitors and 1314 of whom had died. 485 of the men born during 1920-30 and still living in Hertfordshire who had blood lipid measurements.
{MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}: Death from ischaemic heart disease; serum cholesterol and apolipoprotein concentrations.
{RESULTS}: 474 men had died from ischaemic heart disease. Standardised mortality ratios were 97 (95\% confidence interval 81 to 115) in men who had been breast fed and had not been weaned at 1 year, 79 (69 to 90) in breast fed men who had been weaned at 1 year, and 73 (59 to 89) in men who had been breast and bottle fed. Compared with men weaned before one year men not weaned had higher mean serum concentrations of total cholesterol (6.9 (not weaned) v 6.6 (weaned) mmol/l), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (5.0 v 4.6 mmol/l) and apolipoprotein B (1.14 v 1.08 g/l). Men who had been bottle fed also had a high standardised mortality ratio for ischaemic heart disease (95; 68 to 130) and high mean serum concentrations of total cholesterol (7.0 mmol/l), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (5.1 mmol/l), and apolipoprotein B (1.14 g/l). In all feeding groups serum apolipoprotein B concentrations were lower in men with higher birth weight and weight at 1 year.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Age of weaning and method of infant feeding may influence adult serum low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations and mortality from ischaemic heart disease. Adult serum apolipoprotein B concentrations are related to growth in fetal life and infancy.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: To see whether reduced rates of fetal growth are related to raised serum cholesterol concentrations in adult life.
{DESIGN}: Follow up study of men and women whose size at birth had been recorded.
{SETTING}: Jessop and Northern General Hospitals, Sheffield.
{SUBJECTS}: 219 men and women born in the Jessop Hospital during 1939-40.
{MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}: Serum concentrations of total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B.
{RESULTS}: Men and women who had had a small abdominal circumference at birth had raised serum concentrations of total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein B. This was independent of the duration of gestation. Serum concentrations of total cholesterol fell by 0.25 mmol/l (95\% confidence interval 0.09 to 0.42) with each 1 in (2.54 cm) increase in abdominal circumference. The corresponding figure for serum low density lipoprotein cholesterol was 0.26 mmol/l (0.11 to 0.42) and for serum apolipoprotein B 0.04 g/l (0.02 to 0.07). Small head and chest circumferences at birth and short length were each associated with raised serum low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations but the trends disappeared in a simultaneous regression with abdominal circumference at birth. The association between abdominal circumference at birth and low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration was independent of social class, current body weight, cigarette smoking, and alcohol consumption.
{CONCLUSION}: Raised serum cholesterol concentrations in adult life are associated with impaired growth during late gestation, when fetal undernutrition has a disproportionate effect on liver growth. Impaired liver growth may permanently alter low density lipoprotein cholesterol metabolism.},

In this paper, we first extend {COMSTOCK} and {ROBINSON}'s analysis of variance to include linkage, two-locus epistasis and the use of F3 parents. Then we develop the theory and statistical analysis of orthogonal contrasts and contrast x environment interaction for a single marker locus to characterize the effects of {QTL}. The methods are applied to the maize data of C.W. {STUBER}. The analyses strongly suggest that there are multiple linked {QTL} in many chromosomes for several traits examined. {QTL} effects are largely environment-independent for grain yield, ear height, plant height and ear leaf area and largely environment dependent for days to tassel, grain moisture and ear number. There is significant {QTL} epistasis. The results are generally in favor of the hypothesis of dominance of favorable genes to explain the observed heterosis in grain yield and other traits, although epistasis could also play an important role and overdominance at individual {QTL} level can not be ruled out.},

Lipid distributions among children and adolescents were examined using the most recent nationally representative data.
{METHODS}: Data from 7,499 examinees in {NHANES} {III} (1988-1994) were used to estimate mean and percentile distributions of serum total cholesterol, {LDL}-C, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ({HDL}-C), and triglycerides in children and adolescents aged 4 to 19 years. The estimates were analyzed by age, sex, and race/ethnic groups. Trends in mean total cholesterol were examined for 12- to 17-year-olds using data from {NHES} {III} (1966-1970), {NHANES} I (1971-1974), and {NHANES} {III} (1988-1994).
{RESULTS}: For children and adolescents 4 to 19 years of age, the 95th percentile for serum total cholesterol was 216 mg/{dL} and the 75th percentile was 181 mg/{dL}. Mean age-specific total cholesterol levels peaked at 171 mg/{dL} at 9-11 years of age and fell thereafter. Females had significantly higher mean total cholesterol and {LDL}-C levels than did males (P {\textless} 0.005). Non-Hispanic black children and adolescents had significantly higher mean total cholesterol, {LDL}-C, and {HDL}-C levels compared to non-Hispanic white and Mexican American children and adolescents. The mean total cholesterol level among 12- to 17-year-olds decreased by 7 mg/{dL} from 1966-1970 to 1988-1994 and is consistent with, but less than, observed trends in adults. Black females have experienced the smallest decline between surveys.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The findings provide a picture of the lipid distribution among U.S. children and adolescents and indicate that, like adults, adolescents have experienced a fall in total cholesterol levels. Total cholesterol levels in U.S. adolescents declined from the late 1960s to the early 1990s by an average of 7 mg/{dL}. This information is useful for planning programs targeting the prevention of cardiovascular disease beginning with the development of healthy lifestyles in childhood.},

	abstract = {It is commonly agreed that birth weight is associated with blood pressure in adults. However, not much is known about birth length, ponderal index, and early postnatal growth, whose effects on adult blood pressure, if any, can affect the interpretation of the birth weight-blood pressure association. This study examined the association between fetal growth, early postnatal growth, and blood pressure in Chinese adults. One hundred twenty-two subjects born in Hong Kong in 1967 were followed from birth to age 30 years. Multiple linear regression was used to analyze the association between size at birth, postnatal changes in body size, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure at age 30 years. Having adjusted for potential confounders and each other explanatory variable, it is found that birth length standard deviation score (regression coefficient or beta=-3.2), ponderal index at birth (beta=-1.8), and postnatal changes in ponderal index from age 6 months to 18 months (beta=-2.2) were inversely associated with systolic blood pressure (each P{\textless}0.05). Postnatal changes in length standard deviation score were not significantly associated with systolic blood pressure. Birth length standard deviation score was inversely associated with diastolic blood pressure at age 30 years (beta=-2.6; P{\textless}0.05). Other anthropometric variables were not associated with diastolic blood pressure. The results support the hypotheses that both fetal growth and early postnatal growth may have a long-term impact on blood pressure in adults. It also highlights the importance of differentiating length and weight for length.},

	abstract = {The authors analyzed tracking and predictiveness of serum lipid and lipoprotein measurements in Finnish children and young adults over a 12-year follow-up period. A representative sample of 3,596 healthy subjects aged 3-18 years was examined in 1980. The follow-up studies were done in 1983, 1986, 1989, and 1992. Data were available on serum lipids and lipoproteins, anthropometric measurements, dietary and smoking habits, and use of oral contraceptives. Complete data on serum lipids in 1980 and 1992 were available for 883 subjects (47\% males), and they comprised the study cohort for this analysis. Significant tracking was found in each of the serum lipid variables studied. The range of 12-year correlations was 0.48-0.58, 0.53-0.58, 0.53-0.58, 0.57-0.59, and 0.33-0.37 for serum total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein ({LDL}) cholesterol, high density lipoprotein ({HDL}) cholesterol, the {LDL}:{HDL} cholesterol ratio, and triglycerides, respectively. Males showed more tracking than females; there was no clear age trend. Tracking of {HDL}2 cholesterol was better than that of {HDL}3 cholesterol (0.64 vs. 0.43, respectively; 3-year tracking). Apolipoproteins A-I and B showed similar amounts of tracking compared with {HDL} and {LDL} cholesterol, respectively. Approximately 50\% of subjects who initially fell into the extreme quintiles of total cholesterol, {LDL} cholesterol, and {HDL} cholesterol were in the same quintiles after 12 years. In multiple regression analyses, childhood obesity, exercise, diet, and smoking habits did not markedly aid the prediction of adult serum lipid values. However, the use of two childhood measurements increased the amount of adult serum lipid variability explained. Although universal screening cannot be endorsed, these findings emphasize the importance of serum lipid measurements in the early detection of familial lipoprotein disorders and in the initial evaluation of coronary heart disease risk in childhood.},

Of the twenty-four other common causes of death only bronchitis, stomach cancer, and rheumatic heart disease were similarly related to infant mortality. These diseases are associated with poor living conditions and mortality from them is declining. Ischaemic heart disease is strongly correlated with both neonatal and postneonatal mortality.

	abstract = {Compelling evidence exists that the atherosclerotic process begins in childhood and progresses slowly into adulthood, at which time it leads frequently to coronary heart disease ({CHD}), the major cause of death in the United States. Despite substantial success in reducing {CHD} mortality in the past two decades, the disease is still responsible for more than 500 000 deaths annually. About 20\% of hospital discharges for acute {CHD} are for premature disease, ie, in patients younger than 55 years of age. Many of these adults have children who may have {CHD} risk factors that need attention. Estimates of the annual cost of {CHD} range from 41.5 to 56 billion. The Report of the Expert Panel on Blood Cholesterol Levels in Children and Adolescents (which appears as a supplement to this issue of the journal) reviews the evidence that atherosclerosis or its precursors begin in young people; that elevated cholesterol levels early in life play a role in the development of adult atherosclerosis; that eating patterns and genetics affect blood cholesterol levels and {CHD} risk; and that lowering levels in children and adolescents will be beneficial. Cholesterol is the focus of the report, but other risk factors for atherosclerosis and {CHD} may originate early in life and should be addressed as well. Specifically, cigarette smoking should be discouraged; hypertension should be identified and treated; obesity should be avoided or reduced; regular aerobic exercise should be encouraged; and diabetes mellitus should be diagnosed and treated. {SIGNIFICANCE} {OF} {BLOOD} {CHOLESTEROL} {LEVELS} {IN} {CHILDHOOD} {AND} {ADOLESCENCE}},

	title = {Tracking of serum lipids and lipoproteins from childhood to adulthood. The Bogalusa Heart Study},
	volume = {133},
	issn = {0002-9262},
	abstract = {Serum lipids (total cholesterol and triglycerides) and lipoprotein cholesterol fractions (low density lipoprotein ({LDL}) cholesterol, very low density lipoprotein ({VLDL}) cholesterol, and high density lipoprotein ({HDL}) cholesterol) have been measured approximately every 3 years on children and young adults since 1973-1974 in Bogalusa, Louisiana, a community of approximately 22,000 individuals, one-third of whom are black and two-thirds of whom are white. A total of 1,586 children were examined both at baseline (1973-1974) and at the most recent survey (1984-1986), providing 12 years of follow-up. The decreases in levels noted during puberty for total cholesterol and {LDL} cholesterol, primarily for boys, were followed by a rise until age 26 years. {HDL} cholesterol levels, particularly for white boys, continued to drop after age 14 years, yielding increasingly high {LDL} cholesterol/{HDL} cholesterol ratios. Tracking, as measured by both correlation coefficients and persistence at extreme quartiles, was evident for all of the lipids and lipoproteins. The 12-year correlation coefficients were greatest for {LDL} cholesterol and no trend in the magnitude of the correlation coefficients with age was noted. Tracking for {HDL} cholesterol was better after age 9 years, particularly for white males. Approximately 50\% of those children who had total cholesterol levels or {LDL} cholesterol levels above the 75th percentile at baseline remained elevated 12 years later. For {HDL} cholesterol, a trend with age was noted for white boys: 42\% of those aged 9-14 years in the lower most quartile persisted in this rank 12 years later. The best predictor of follow-up lipid or lipoprotein level was baseline level. The next best predictor was increase in weight as defined by weight/height, an index of obesity. That serum lipid and lipoprotein levels continue to track from childhood into young adulthood points to the necessity of measurement early in life and, where indicated, the introduction of preventive and interventional programs aimed at developing healthy lifestyles.},

	abstract = {Iron deficiency remains the most common nutritional deficiency worldwide and supplementation is recommended during periods of high risk, including infancy. However, questions have been raised about possible adverse effects of iron on growth in iron-sufficient ({IS}) infants and the advisability of across-the-board iron supplementation. This study examined whether short- or long-term growth was impaired in {IS} infants who received iron supplementation. From a longitudinal study of healthy, breast-fed, low- to middle-income Chilean infants randomly assigned to iron supplementation or usual nutrition at 6 or 12 mo, we retrospectively identified infants meeting criteria for iron sufficiency at the time of random assignment (n = 273). Using multilevel analysis, ponderal and linear growth were modeled before, during, and after iron supplementation up to 10 y in 3 comparisons: 1) iron supplementation compared with usual nutrition from 6 to 12 mo; 2) iron supplementation compared with usual nutrition from 12 to 18 mo; and 3) 15 mg/d of iron as drops compared with iron-fortified formula (12 mg/L). Growth trajectories did not differ during or after supplementation indicating no adverse effect of iron in any comparison. These results suggest that, at least in some environments, iron does not impair growth in {IS} infants.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: This experimental study aimed to prospectively investigate the impact of combinations of prenatal and postnatal food manipulations on the metabolic profile of adult offspring.
{DESIGN}: On day 12 of gestation, 67 timed pregnant rats were randomized into three nutritional groups, control: standard laboratory food; starved: 50\% food restricted, {FR}; fat-fed: fat-rich diet, {FF}. Seven hundred and seventy-four (774) pups were born on day 21 and culled to 8 (4 males, 4 females) per litter to normalize rearing. Rats born to starved mothers were later subdivided, based on birthweight ({BiW}), into fetal growth restricted ({FGR}) and non-{FGR}. The pups were then weaned to the diet of their fostered mother until one year old. Thus, 12 groups were studied: 1.
{CONTROL}/{CONTROL}: 14 rats, 2.
{CONTROL}/{FR}: 12 rats, 3.
{CONTROL}/{FF}: 15 rats, 4.
{FGR}/{CONTROL}: 16 rats, 5.
{FGR}/{FR}: 10 rats, 6.
{FGR}/{FF}: 15 rats, 7. non-
{FGR}/{CONTROL}: 10 rats, 8. non-
{FGR}/{FR}: 17 rats, 9. non-
{FGR}/{FF}: 10 rats, 10.
{FF}/{CONTROL}: 15 rats, 11.
{FF}/{FR}: 14 rats, and 12.
{FF}/{FF}: 13 rats. During sacrifice, body weight ({BW}) and liver weight ({LW}) were measured (expressed in grams) and concentrations of serum glucose, triglycerides, {HDL} and {NEFA} were determined.
{RESULTS}: Postnatal food restriction, compared to control diet significantly reduced {BW} (p=0.004, p=0.036, p{\textless}0.001, p=0.008) and {LW} (p{\textless}0.001) in all study groups. Postnatal control diet significantly increased {BW} in non-{FGR} compared to {FGR} rats (p=0.027). No significant differences were detected in biochemical parameters (excluding {NEFA}) between {FGR} and non-{FGR}, regardless of the postnatal diet.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Interaction between prenatal and postnatal nutrition produces distinct metabolic profiles. Apart from {BiW}, prenatal diet had an important impact on the metabolic profile of the adult offspring, implying that intrauterine events should be considered in the estimation of the metabolic risk of an individual, independently of {BiW}.},

In an expanded genome-wide association meta-analysis and follow-up study of birth weight (of up to 69,308 individuals of European descent from 43 studies), we have now extended the number of loci associated at genome-wide significance to 7, accounting for a similar proportion of variance as maternal smoking.

	abstract = {Back ground

Multiple risk factor interventions using counselling and educational methods assumed to be efficacious and cost-effective in reducing coronary heart disease ({CHD}) mortality and morbidity and that they should be expanded. Trials examining risk factor changes have cast doubt on the effectiveness of these interventions.

Objectives

To assess the effects of multiple risk factor interventions for reducing total mortality, fatal and non-fatal events from {CHD} and cardiovascular risk factors among adults assumed to be without prior clinical evidence {CHD}..

Search strategy

We updated the original search {BY} {SEARCHING} {CENTRAL} (2006, Issue 2), {MEDLINE} (2000 to June 2006) and {EMBASE} (1998 to June 2006), and checking bibliographies.

Selection criteria

Randomised controlled trials of more than six months duration using counselling or education to modify more than one cardiovascular risk factor in adults from general populations, occupational groups or specific risk factors (i.e. diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, obesity).

Data collection and analysis

Two authors extracted data independently. We expressed categorical variables as odds ratios ({OR}) with 95\% confidence intervals ({CI}). Where studies published subsequent follow-up data on mortality and event rates, we updated these data.

Main results

We found 55 trials (163,471 participants) with a median duration of 12 month follow up. Fourteen trials (139,256 participants) with reported clinical event endpoints, the pooled {ORs} for total and {CHD} mortality were 1.00 (95\% {CI} 0.96 to 1.05) and 0.99 (95\% {CI} 0.92 to 1.07), respectively. Total mortality and combined fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events showed benefits from intervention when confined to trials involving people with hypertension (16 trials) and diabetes (5 trials): {OR} 0.78 (95\% {CI} 0.68 to 0.89) and {OR} 0.71 (95\% {CI} 0.61 to 0.83), respectively. Net changes (weighted mean differences) in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (53 trials) and blood cholesterol (50 trials) were -2.71 {mmHg} (95\% {CI} -3.49 to -1.93), -2.13 {mmHg} (95\% {CI} -2.67 to -1.58) and -0.24 mmol/l (95\% {CI} -0.32 to -0.16), respectively. The {OR} for reduction in smoking prevalence (20 trials) was 0.87 (95\% {CI} 0.75 to 1.00). Marked heterogeneity (I-2 {\textgreater} 85\%) for all risk factor analyses was not explained by co-morbidities, allocation concealment, use of antihypertensive or cholesterol-lowering drugs, or by age of trial.

Authors' conclusions

Interventions using counselling and education aimed at behaviour change do not reduce total or {CHD} mortality or clinical events in general populations but may be effective in reducing mortality in high-risk hypertensive and diabetic populations. Risk factor declines were modest but owing to marked unexplained heterogeneity between trials, the pooled estimates are of dubious validity. Evidence suggests that health promotion interventions have limited use in general populations.

	abstract = {Despite significant progress in understanding the mechanisms by which the prenatal/maternal environment can alter development and adult health, genetic influences on normal variation in growth are little understood. This work examines genetic and nongenetic contributions to body weight and weight change during infancy and the relationships between weight change and adult body composition. The dataset included 501 white infants in 164 nuclear and extended families in the Fels Longitudinal Study, each with 10 serial measures of weight from birth to age 3 years and 232 with body composition data in mid-adulthood. Heritability and covariate effects on weight and weight z-score change from birth to 2 years of age were estimated using a maximum likelihood variance decomposition method. Additive genetic effects explained a high proportion of the variance in infant weight status (h2=0.61-0.95), and change in weight z-score (h2=0.56-0.82). Covariate effects explained 27\% of the phenotypic variance at 0-1 month of age and declined in effect to 6.9\% of phenotypic variance by 36 months. Significant sex, gestational age, birth order, birth year, and maternal body mass index effects were also identified. For both sexes, a significant increase in weight z-score ({\textgreater}2 {SD} units) (upward centile crossing) was associated with greater adulthood stature, fat mass, and percent body fat than decrease or stability in weight z-score. Understanding genetic influences on growth rate in a well-nourished, nutritionally stable population may help us interpret the causes and consequences of centile crossing in nutritionally compromised contexts.},

	abstract = {Evidence suggesting an effect of fetal growth on liver development and function stems from both animal and human studies. The association of birthweight with adult markers of liver damage and function was examined in a random sample of 2101 British women aged 60-79 years. Age-adjusted natural logged levels of alanine aminotransferase ({ALT}) and gamma glutamyltransferase ({GGT}) decreased linearly across increasing thirds of birthweight. Alkaline phosphatase ({ALP}) levels were higher in women of the lowest third of the birthweight distribution compared with other women. No evidence was found for associations of birthweight with aspartate aminotransferase ({AST}), total bilirubin and albumin. After full adjustment for social class, physical activity, smoking and alcohol consumption, an increase in one standard deviation of birthweight (691 g) was associated with a 2\% ([95\% {CI} 0\%, 4\%], P = 0.021) decrease in the geometric mean of {ALT}, a 4\% decrease in {GGT} ([95\% {CI} 1\%, 6\%], P = 0.008) and a 2\% decrease in {ALP} ([95\% {CI} 0\%, 3\%], P = 0.001). Associations of birthweight with {ALT} and {GGT}, but not with {ALP}, were attenuated when adjusting for components of the metabolic syndrome. These findings suggest that factors affecting intrauterine growth may increase the propensity for adult liver damage. The attenuation of associations with adjustment for components of the metabolic syndrome is in line with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, indicated by elevated {ALT} and {GGT}, being the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome, and of the influence of perinatal factors on this syndrome.},

Aim: To study serum lipid levels in a representative sample of children and teenagers for Concepcion, Chile. Subjects and methods: Serum total, {HDL} cholesterol and triglycerides were measured in 1,286 males and 816 females from 5 to 18 years old in the city of Concepcion. Results: Mean total cholesterol levels were 159+/-30 and 162+/-31 mg/dl in males and females respectively. The figures for {HDL} cholesterol were 46+/-11 and 47+/-11 mg/dl, for {LDL} cholesterol were 94+/-27 and 96+/-29 mg/dl and for triglycerides were 80+/-35 and 87+/-38 mg/dl. Nine percent of males and 12\% of females had a total cholesterol over 200 mg/dl. Likewise 10\% of males and 11\% of females had a {LDL} cholesterol over 130 mg/dl. Conclusions: These numbers will help to plan and perform interventions in children, in order to prevent cardiovascular diseases.},

	title = {Tracking of serum cholesterol and lipoprotein levels from the first year of life},
	volume = {91},
	issn = {0031-4005},
	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: To examine the development of tracking of serum cholesterol concentration from birth to childhood.
{DESIGN}: In a longitudinal study of healthy children, concentrations of total serum cholesterol and triglyceride were determined at birth (n = 193); at 2 (n = 192), 4 (n = 192), 6 (n = 190), 7.5 (n = 118), 9 (n = 188), and 12 months (n = 196); and at 5 years of age (n = 162). Concentrations of cholesterol--very-low-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein-2 ({HDL}2), and {HDL}3--were determined at 2, 6, 9, and 12 months (n = 36) and at 5 years (n = 162).
{RESULTS}: The correlation coefficients of total cholesterol levels during the first year of life with the level at 5 years of age were as follows: at birth .04, at 2 months .36 (P {\textless} .001), at 4 months .26 (P {\textless} .001), at 6 months .28 (P {\textless} .001), at 7.5 months .25 (P {\textless} .001), at 9 months .35 (P {\textless} .001), and at 12 months .48 (P {\textless} .001). The correlation for exclusively breast-fed children between 6 months and 5 years of age was r = .37, P {\textless} .001, while that for children receiving partially breast milk, formula, or solid foods was r = .12, P = not significant ({NS}), and between 9 months and 5 years r = .38, P {\textless} .01, and r = .28, P {\textless} .05, respectively. The correlation coefficients of the lipoprotein levels between ages 12 months and 5 years were as follows: low-density lipoprotein cholesterol .58 (P {\textless} .001), total {HDL} cholesterol .30 (P {\textless} .05), {HDL}2 cholesterol .34 (P {\textless} .05), {HDL}3 cholesterol .17 (P = {NS}), very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol .24 (P = {NS}), total triglyceride .37 (P {\textless} .05), and triglyceride-very-low-density lipoprotein .37 (P {\textless} .05). Of the children whose total serum cholesterol level was above the 90th percentile at birth, or at 2, 4, 6, 7.5, 9, or 12 months, 6\%, 35\%, 29\%, 30\%, 31\%, 33\%, and 45\%, respectively, were above the 90th percentile at 5 years of age. In retrospect, 45\% of the children whose serum cholesterol level was above the 90th percentile at 5 years were above the 90th percentile at the age of 12 months and 80\% were in the highest quartile.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The results indicate that tracking of serum cholesterol concentration during the first year of life is stronger when examining children who are receiving a relatively homogenous diet, such as exclusive breast-feeding, and weaker as children are weaned to formula and solid foods. After the weaning process is completed, children's relative serum cholesterol levels have become established and the tracking of serum cholesterol is of the same magnitude as for older children and adolescents.},

Growth mixture modeling represents unobserved heterogeneity among the subjects using a finite-mixture random effects model. The methodology allows one to examine the impact of an intervention on subgroups characterized by different types of growth trajectories. Such modeling is informative when examining effects on populations that contain individuals who have normative growth as well as non-normative growth. The analysis identifies subgroup membership and allows theory-based modeling of intervention effects in the different subgroups. An example is presented concerning a randomized intervention in Baltimore public schools aimed at reducing aggressive classroom behavior, where only students who were initially more aggressive showed benefits from the intervention.},

	doi = {10.3305/nh.2013.28.3.6359},
	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION} {AND} {OBJECTIVES}:

Plasma lipid levels in children and adolescents are evaluated with international references. The objective was to describe them in Chilean students, to compare them with the most used reference (Lipids Research Clinics Program) and the cut-off points recommended in 2011.
{METHODS}:

Cross-sectional study in 3325 children, 10 to 14 years of age. Anthropometry and auto-report of pubertal development were performed. A 12 hours fast blood sample was taken to measure total ({TC}), highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol ({HDLC}) and triglycerides ({TG}). Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ({LDLC}) was calculated with Friedewald formula. Variables were described, Hochberg test for multiple comparisons and stepwise lineal regression were applied. The degree of agreement between local percentiles and the two international references was studied.
{RESULTS}:

We studied 3,063 children, 11.4 ± 0.9 years old, 53\% girls, 20.9\% pre-pubertal, 22.6\% had overweight, and 15.8\% obesity. Averages: {TC}: 159.2 ± 28.3, {HDLC}: 51.9 ± 12.1, {LDLC}: 89.0 ± 31.5 and {TG}: 93.2 ± 60 mg/{dL}. Boys had higher {HDLC}: 53.3 ± 12.2 vs. 50.6 ± 11.8 mg/{dL} and lower {TG}: 86.2 ± 58.2 vs. 99.5 ± 61.7 mg/{dL} than girls (p {\textless} 0,001). Influences of nutritional status, sex and age were significant. We founded high agreement with the reference for {TC} and {LDLC}, but {HDLC} levels were lower and {TG} were higher, for their cut-off points: percentiles 10th and 95th, respectively.
{CONCLUSIONS}:

Blood lipids were influenced by nutritional status, sex and age. Percentile values were comparable to the international reference except for {HDLC} and {TG}, showing a more atherogenic pattern.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Because {LDL}-cholesterol ({LDL}-C) is a modifiable risk for coronary heart disease, its routine measurement is recommended in the evaluation and management of hypercholesterolemia. We critically examine here the new homogeneous assays for direct determination of {LDL}-C.
{APPROACH}: This review relies on published studies and data of the authors using research and routine methods for {LDL}-C determination. We review experience with methods from their earlier use in lipid research laboratories through the transition to routine clinical testing and the recent development of homogeneous assays. We focus on comparative evaluations and characterizations and the performance of the assays.
{CONTENT}: Homogeneous assays seem to be able to meet current National Cholesterol Education Program ({NCEP}) requirements for {LDL}-C testing for precision ({CV} {\textless}4\%) and accuracy (bias {\textless}4\%), when samples collected from nonfasting individuals are used. In addition, all five currently available assays have been certified by the Cholesterol Reference Methods Laboratory Network. The homogeneous methods also appear to better classify individuals into {NCEP} cutpoints than the Friedewald calculation. However, the limited evaluations to date raise questions about their reliability and specificity, especially in samples with atypical lipoproteins.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Available evidence supports recommending the homogeneous assays for {LDL}-C to supplement the Friedewald calculation in those cases where the calculation is known to be unreliable, e.g., triglycerides {\textgreater}4000 mg/L. Before the homogeneous assays can be confidently recommended to replace the calculation in routine practice, more evaluation is needed.},

We examined whether the trajectories, from adolescence to young adulthood, of blood pressure, body fatness and fat distribution, blood lipids, cardiorespiratory fitness, and heart rate determined levels of arterial stiffness in young adults. We investigated 373 apparently healthy adults in whom cardiovascular risk factors were repeatedly examined between the ages of 13 and 36 years and carotid stiffness estimates were obtained at the age of 36 years. Differences in the mean levels and the trajectories of risk factors throughout the 24-year longitudinal period between subjects with different levels of carotid stiffness at age 36 years were analyzed with generalized estimating equations. Compared with individuals with less stiff carotid arteries, those with stiffer carotid arteries at the age of 36 years were characterized from ages 13 to 36 years by greater levels of and steeper increases in blood pressure and central fatness, independently of each other and other risk factors. These increases were already present in adolescence, preceded the development of poorer levels of blood lipids, cardiorespiratory fitness, and heart rate, which were evident during adulthood only, and explained to a great extent the deleterious association between these risk factors and carotid stiffness at the age of 36 years. Multiple and intertwined mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of arterial stiffness have their origins in early life. Blood pressure and central fatness have a pivotal role herein and should be specifically targeted to prevent arterial stiffening and its cardiovascular sequelae. (Hypertension. 2012; 59: 54-61.).

	abstract = {Background-Higher carotid intimal-medial thickness ({IMT}) is associated with cardiovascular risk factors and is predictive of coronary artery disease and stroke in older adults. Carotid {IMT} was measured in young and middle-aged adults to determine its relationship with risk factors measured (1) in childhood, (2) currently, and (3) as a "load" from childhood to adulthood.

Methods and Results-Carotid ultrasound studies were performed in 346 men and 379 women aged 33 to 42 years who were representative of a cohort followed since childhood and who live in Muscatine, Iowa. The mean of the measurements of maximal carotid {IMT} at 12 locations was determined for each subject. A medical questionnaire was completed, and measurements of anthropometric characteristics and risk factors were obtained. The mean maximum carotid {IMT} was 0.79 +/-0.12 min for men and 0.72 +/-0.10 mm for women. On the basis of multivariable analysis, the significant current predictors of {IMT} were age and {LDL} cholesterol in both sexes and diastolic blood pressure in women. Total cholesterol was a significant childhood predictor in both sexes, while childhood body mass index was significant only in women. For men, {LDL} cholesterol, {HDL} cholesterol, and diastolic blood pressure were predictive of carotid {IMT} in a risk factor load model, whereas in women, {LDL} cholesterol, body mass index, and triglycerides were predictive.

Conclusions-Higher carotid {IMT} in young and middle-aged adults is associated with childhood and current cardiovascular risk factors, as well as risk factor load.},

The proposed concepts and methods are useful for particular problems, but it would be of concern if the theory and practice of the complete field of epidemiology were to become restricted to this single approach to causal inference. Our concerns are that this theory restricts the questions that epidemiologists may ask and the study designs that they may consider. It also restricts the evidence that may be considered acceptable to assess causality, and thereby the evidence that may be considered acceptable for scientific and public health decision making. These restrictions are based on a particular conceptual framework for thinking about causality. In Section 1, we describe the characteristics of the restricted potential outcomes approach ({RPOA}) and show that there is a methodological movement which advocates these principles, not just for solving particular problems, but as ideals for which epidemiology as a whole should strive. In Section 2, we seek to show that the limitation of epidemiology to one particular view of the nature of causality is problematic. In Section 3, we argue that the {RPOA} is also problematic with regard to the assessment of causality. We argue that it threatens to restrict study design choice, to wrongly discredit the results of types of observational studies that have been very useful in the past and to damage the teaching of epidemiological reasoning. Finally, in Section 4 we set out what we regard as a more reasonable 'working hypothesis' as to the nature of causality and its assessment: pragmatic pluralism.},

The places where a child lives and attends to school are both major environmental and social determinants of its present and future health status. Noncommunicable diseases ({NCDs}) and some of their risk factors among child and adolescent populations are obesity and dyslipidemia, so finding the patterns of distribution of these risk factors by gender, type of school, area, and margination level is important to do health intervention focusing in their necessities to prevent diseases at younger ages. Because of that, a cross-sectional study was performed among elementary and junior high school students from public and private schools in six of the seven areas of the metropolitan zone of San Luis Potosi, Mexico. Biochemical dyslipidemia indicators (triglycerides, total cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein) and anthropometric data (weight and height) were obtained. Seventeen public schools and five private schools with a total of 383 students were included. More than half of the studied population (53.0 \%) had elevated triglyceride levels. A total of 330 students (86.2 \%) had normal levels of total cholesterol with a mean value of 141.7 mg/dl, and 202 schoolchildren (52.8 \%) had lower than acceptable levels of high-density lipoprotein ({HDL}) with a mean value of 43.9 mg/dl. There were differences in the levels of highdensity protein between the areas and the type of school where they had been studied. Finally, a total of 150 students (39.4 \%) had at least one altered lipid value and 103 participants (26.9 \%) had two altered values. Several students, despite their young age, showed a high prevalence of risk factors, so it is important to design programs according to their necessities.},

	issn = {1565-4753},
	abstract = {In the circulation, cholesterol and triglycerides are enveloped in apolipoproteins and phospholipids, and transported as complex particles called lipoproteins. Abnormal levels of lipoproteins occur in children either because of a genetic defect in lipid metabolism pathways (primary lipid disorders, e.g. familial hypercholesterolemia [{FH}]) or secondary to other diseases or conditions (e.g. insulin resistance) and can be clinically significant; for example, elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels are a major risk factor for future cardiovascular disease. Patients with primary lipid disorders in childhood such as {FH} can exhibit early atherosclerotic lesions in childhood. Other risk factors for cardiovascular disease, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus, are increasingly common in the pediatric population, and are often associated with dyslipidemia. Thus, pediatricians should be aware of how to screen, diagnose and treat dyslipidemia. The majority of lipid disorders in children can be managed with diet and lifestyle modification. Pharmacologic therapy (e.g. statins) may be added if target lipoprotein levels are not achieved. Clinicians may be guided in patient management by recent scientific statements from the American Heart Association; however, existing National Cholesterol Education Program treatment guidelines should be urgently updated to incorporate new evidence regarding atherosclerosis pathophysiology, obesity and the metabolic syndrome, emerging cardiovascular risk factors, and pharmacologic therapy in pediatric patients.},

The guidelines differ from the selective screening recommended by the 2007 {US} Preventive Services Task Force, instead recommending routine lipid screening for children and adolescents at ages 9-11 years and again at 17-21 years. Studies have shown that limiting lipid screening to patients with risk factors fails to identify many patients with genetic or acquired dyslipidemias. Without universal screening, many at-risk children will not be identified.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: To examine whether method of infant feeding is associated with adult serum lipid concentrations and mortality from ischaemic heart disease.
{DESIGN}: Follow up study of men born during 1911-30.
{SETTING}: Hertfordshire, England.
{SUBJECTS}: 5718 men, for 5471 of whom information on infant feeding had been recorded by health visitors and 1314 of whom had died. 485 of the men born during 1920-30 and still living in Hertfordshire who had blood lipid measurements.
{MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}: Death from ischaemic heart disease; serum cholesterol and apolipoprotein concentrations.
{RESULTS}: 474 men had died from ischaemic heart disease. Standardised mortality ratios were 97 (95\% confidence interval 81 to 115) in men who had been breast fed and had not been weaned at 1 year, 79 (69 to 90) in breast fed men who had been weaned at 1 year, and 73 (59 to 89) in men who had been breast and bottle fed. Compared with men weaned before one year men not weaned had higher mean serum concentrations of total cholesterol (6.9 (not weaned) v 6.6 (weaned) mmol/l), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (5.0 v 4.6 mmol/l) and apolipoprotein B (1.14 v 1.08 g/l). Men who had been bottle fed also had a high standardised mortality ratio for ischaemic heart disease (95; 68 to 130) and high mean serum concentrations of total cholesterol (7.0 mmol/l), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (5.1 mmol/l), and apolipoprotein B (1.14 g/l). In all feeding groups serum apolipoprotein B concentrations were lower in men with higher birth weight and weight at 1 year.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Age of weaning and method of infant feeding may influence adult serum low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations and mortality from ischaemic heart disease. Adult serum apolipoprotein B concentrations are related to growth in fetal life and infancy.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Dyslipidemias are a key cardiovascular risk factor, and are increased since early childhood. The objective of this study was to describe the prevalence, characteristics of dyslipidemias and associated factors in a population of Chilean children.

Methods: Cross-sectional study done in school-age children from Santiago, Chile (2009-2011). Parents answered questions about family medical history and children answered questions about physical activity. Anthropometry was performed and in a blood sample (12 hours fast) lipid profile, glycemia and insulinemia were measured.

Results: We recruited 2900 euglycemic children, 11.4 +/- 0.97 years old, 52\% girls. According to {BMI}, 22.5\% were overweight and 15,3\% had obesity. Considering recommended cut-off points for lipids, 69.3\% were in acceptable range, 19.2\% at risk and 11.5\% at high cardiovascular risk. In total, 32\% of the population had any clinical form of dyslipidemia: Isolated hypertriglyceridemia (9.4\%), low {HDL}-C (7.6\%), isolated hypercholesterolemia (4.9\%), atherogenic dyslipidemia (6.24\%) and mixed dyslipidemia (3.9\%). Except for isolated hypercholesterolemia, dyslipidemias were more frequent in girls (globally 36.2\% vs. 27.4\%, p{\textless}0.0001). Low {HDL}-C was associated with sedentary lifestyle. In multiple logistic regression analysis, nutritional status was the most important associated factor, with less influence of age, sex, central obesity, insulin resistance and history of parental cardiovascular risk factors.

Conclusions: In this population of Chilean school-age children, we found a high prevalence of dyslipidemia, and the principal determinant was weight excess.},

Notions of direct and indirect effects from a counterfactual approach to mediation are compared with those arising from the standard regression approach to mediation of Baron and Kenny (1986), commonly utilized in the social science literature. It is shown that concepts of direct and indirect effect from causal inference generalize those described by Baron and Kenny and that under appropriate identification assumptions these more general direct and indirect effects from causal inference can be estimated using regression even when there are interactions between the primary exposure of interest and the mediator. A number of conceptual issues are discussed concerning the interpretation of identification conditions for mediation, the notion of counterfactuals based on hypothetical interventions and the so called consistency and composition assumptions.},

	abstract = {Objectives To explore the association between the triglyceride to {HDL}-C ratio ({TG}/{HDL}-C) and insulin resistance in Chinese patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Methods

Patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (272 men and 288 women) were enrolled and divided into three groups according to {TG}/{HDL}-C tertiles. Insulin resistance was defined by homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance ({HOMA}-{IR}). Demographic information and clinical characteristics were obtained. Spearman's correlation was used to estimate the association between {TG}/{HDL}-C and other variables. Multiple logistic regression analyses were adopted to obtain probabilities of insulin resistance. A receiver operating characteristic analysis was conducted to evaluate the ability of {TG}/{HDL}-C to discriminate insulin resistance.

Results

{TG}/{HDL}-C was associated with insulin resistance in Chinese patients with newly diagnosed T2DM (Spearman's correlation coefficient = 0.21, P {\textless} 0.01). Patients in the higher tertiles of {TG}/{HDL}-C had significantly higher {HOMA}-{IR} values than patients in the lower tertiles [T1: 2.68(1.74-3.70); T2: 2.96(2.29-4.56); T3: 3.09(2.30-4.99)]. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that {TG}/{HDL}-C was significantly associated with {HOMA}-{IR}, and patients in the higher {TG}/{HDL}-C tertile had a higher {OR} than those in the lower {TG}/{HDL}-C tertile, after adjusting for multiple covariates including indices for central obesity [T1: 1; T2: 4.02 (1.86-8.71); T3: 4.30(1.99-9.29)]. Following stratification of waist circumference into quartiles, the effect of {TG}/{HDL}-C on insulin resistance remained significant irrespective of waist circumference.

Conclusions

{TG}/{HDL}-C was associated with insulin resistance independent of waist circumference. Whether it could be a surrogate marker for insulin resistance in Chinese patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus still needs to be confirmed by more researches.},

But, the precise correlation between age of laboratory rats and human is still a subject of debate. A number of studies have tried to detect these correlations in various ways, But, have not successfully provided any proper association. Thus, the current review attempts to compare rat and human age at different phases of their life. The overall findings indicate that rats grow rapidly during their childhood and become sexually mature at about the sixth week, but attain social maturity 5-6 months later. In adulthood, every day of the animal is approximately equivalent to 34.8 human days (i.e., one rat month is comparable to three human years). Numerous researchers performed experimental investigations in albino rats and estimated, in general, while considering their entire life span, that a human month resembles every-day life of a laboratory rat. These differences signify the variations in their anatomy, physiology and developmental processes, which must be taken into consideration while analyzing the results or selecting the dose of any research in rats when age is a crucial factor.},

	volume = {138},
	issn = {1541-6100},
	abstract = {Previous studies suggest that both overfeeding and undernutrition during development increase the risk of obesity and hypertension in adulthood. In this study, we examined both short- (24 d) and long- (16 wk) term effects of early postnatal over- and underfeeding in rats on body weight, body composition, plasma hormones, adiposity markers, and hypothalamic neuropeptide Y content. Cardiovascular changes were also examined by measuring blood pressure and cardiac fibrosis. Rats raised in litters of 3, 12, or 18 pups per mother were used to model early onset overfeeding, control, and underfeeding, respectively. At 24 d of age, pups raised in small litters ({SL}) were 10\% heavier than pups from normal litters, accompanied by increased organ mass and fat mass, elevated plasma leptin, corticosterone, and uncoupling protein-1 {mRNA} in brown adipose tissue. On the other hand, pups raised in large litters were 17\% lighter with no significant changes in plasma leptin. Overfeeding during the first 3 wk of life led to increased plasma leptin concentration in adulthood, whereas underfed rats remained significantly lighter throughout the study, with no evidence of catch-up growth. Rats raised in {SL} were more susceptible to developing cardiac fibrosis with a 22\% increase in collagen deposition compared with control rats at 16 wk of age (P {\textless} 0.05). This was independent of any changes in blood pressure. This study demonstrates that nutritional changes early in postnatal development can have long-lasting effects on body weight, adiposity, and some mediators involved in energy homeostasis and can also lead to structural changes in the heart in adulthood. This highlights the importance of identifying potential early life risk factors involved in the modulation of childhood nutrition.},

	abstract = {Several methods for screening gene-environment interaction have recently been proposed that address the issue of using gene-environment independence in a data-adaptive way. In this report, the authors present a comparative simulation study of power and type I error properties of 3 classes of procedures: 1) the standard 1-step case-control method; 2) the case-only method that requires an assumption of gene-environment independence for the underlying population; and 3) a variety of hybrid methods, including empirical-Bayes, 2-step, and model averaging, that aim at gaining power by exploiting the assumption of gene-environment independence and yet can protect against false positives when the independence assumption is violated. These studies suggest that, although the case-only method generally has maximum power, it has the potential to create substantial false positives in large-scale studies even when a small fraction of markers are associated with the exposure under study in the underlying population. All the hybrid methods perform well in protecting against such false positives and yet can retain substantial power advantages over standard case-control tests. The authors conclude that, for future genome-wide scans for gene-environment interactions, major power gain is possible by using alternatives to standard case-control analysis. Whether a case-only type scan or one of the hybrid methods should be used depends on the strength and direction of gene-environment interaction and association, the level of tolerance for false positives, and the nature of replication strategies.},

	abstract = {Recent evidence demonstrates that the environment in early life can have important effects on fetal and postnatal growth, on development and on risk of developing common non-communicable diseases in later life. In animals, the environment during early life induces altered phenotypes in ways which are influenced or mediated by epigenetic mechanisms. The latter include {DNA} methylation, covalent modifications of histones and non-coding {RNAs}. Most is known about {DNA} methylation changes, which are gene specific, include effects on non-imprinted genes and function at the level of individual {CpG} dinucleotides to alter gene expression. Preliminary evidence from human studies suggests a similar important role for epigenetic processes. Tuning of phenotype by the developmental environment has adaptive value because it attempts to match an individual's responses to the environment predicted to be experienced later; hence, such processes have been selected during evolution as conferring fitness advantage. When the phenotype is mismatched, e.g. from inaccurate nutritional cues from the mother or placenta before birth, or from rapid environmental change through improved socioeconomic conditions, risk of non-communicable diseases increases. Evidence is accruing that endocrine or nutritional interventions during early postnatal life can reverse epigenetic and phenotypic changes induced, for example, by unbalanced maternal diet during pregnancy. Elucidation of epigenetic processes may enable early intervention strategies to improve early development and growth. Copyright (c) 2013 Nestec Ltd., Vevey/S. Karger {AG}, Basel},

	abstract = {Low birthweight is now known to be associated with increased rates of coronary heart disease and the related disorders stroke, hypertension and non-insulin-dependent diabetes. These associations have been extensively replicated in studies in different countries and are not the result of confounding variables. They extend across the normal range of birthweight and depend on lower birthweights in relation to the duration of gestation rather than the effects of premature birth. The associations are thought to be consequences of developmental plasticity, the phenomenon by which one genotype can give rise to a range of different physiological or morphological states in response to different environmental conditions during development. Recent observations have shown that impaired growth in infancy and rapid childhood weight gain exacerbate the effects of impaired prenatal growth. Coronary heart disease and the disorders related to it arise through a series of interactions between environmental influences and the pathways of development that preceded them. These diseases are the product of branching pathways of development in which the branchings are triggered by the environment before and after birth.},

	abstract = {Nutrition in infancy has been suggested to have a major influence or program the long-term tendency to obesity. Breastfeeding, in particular, appears to protect against the development of later obesity, a conclusion supported by data from four systematic reviews and evidence that a longer duration of breastfeeding has greater protective effects. The size of the effect (up to a 20\% reduction in obesity risk) although modest has important implications for public health. The mechanisms involved, although poorly understood, probably include the benefits of relative undernutrition and slower growth associated with breast rather than formula feeding - the growth acceleration hypothesis. This hypothesis is now supported by data from animal studies and two recent systematic reviews, which suggest an association between faster growth in infancy and later obesity in both richer and low-income countries and for both faster weight and length gain. The present review considers the evidence for a role of early growth and breastfeeding in the programming of obesity and the underlying mechanisms involved.},

This has led to a wide variety in how results of latent trajectory analysis are reported. To overcome this issue, using a 4-round Delphi study, we developed Guidelines for Reporting on Latent Trajectory Studies ({GRoLTS}). The purpose of {GRoLTS} is to present criteria that should be included when reporting the results of latent trajectory analysis across research fields. We have gone through a systematic process to identify key components that, according to a panel of experts, are necessary when reporting results for trajectory studies. We applied {GRoLTS} to 38 papers where {LGMM} or {LCGA} was used to study trajectories of posttraumatic stress after a traumatic event.},
